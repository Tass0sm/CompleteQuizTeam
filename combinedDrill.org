Pencil and paper will not be necessary. The derivative of the
hyperbolic version of this trigonometric function is (ex – e-x ) / 2
(“e to the x minus e to the negative x, all divided by 2”). The Taylor
series expansion of this function consists of terms in which a
variable raised to an odd power is divided by the factorial of that
power. The equation stating that a triangle side’s length divided by
this function of its opposite angle is equal for all combinations of
angles and sides is known as the “law of” this function. This
trigonometric function is the reciprocal of the cosecant. Name this
function that, for a given angle in a right triangle, is equal to
“opposite over hypotenuse.”

systems of linear equations. One of these shapes is inscribed into a
circle by Thales’ (THAY-leez-iz) theorem. The area of one of these
shapes can be determined by halving the magnitude of the cross product
of two vectors.  The inequality named for these objects is proven by

Pencil and paper will not be necessary. Jacobi’s theorem states that
for odd square matrices with the “skew” type of this property, its
determinant is equal to zero. Generally speaking, these matrices equal
their own transpose. In set theory, a relation has this property if
for every element “B” and element “A”, if “A” relates to “B” then it
must be the case that “B” relates to “A”. An equivalence relation
requires this property along with transitivity (trans-ih-TIV-ih-tee)

refers to the ability to fold a shape onto itself?

This technique is demonstrably valid via the well-ordering
principle. Often used to verify a summation formula, many
mathematicians make use of this technique’s strong form, so that all
statements from “1 to n” are true. This technique starts with proving
a base case and then assuming that a statement at n is true; all that
is needed to be done is to show that the correctness of n implies the
correctness of “n + 1” (“n plus one”). Name this mathematical proof
technique which shares its name with a type of reasoning that makes
generalizations from the specific.

Pencil and paper will not be necessary. A permutation is made from the
Fischer-Yates algorithm, which requires numbers with this property as
an input. Variables with this property are functions that map from the
set of all outcomes to the real numbers. Markov and Weiner processes
possess this property. Generating numbers with this property is
actually impossible; thus the “pseudo-” version of this property is
desired instead. This property is synonymous with stochastic. Name
this property of certain sequences of numbers which makes them
unpredictable.

was used by Apollonius [app-uh-LOH-nee-uss] of Perga to trisect an

Pencil and paper will not be necessary. The “harmonics” of this
coordinate system are the solutions to Laplace’s (LUH-plass-iz)
equation where the radial coordinates are given by Bessel (BESS-ull)
functions. These coordinates are useful when longitudinal symmetry is
present, such as a system where water flows down a pipe or an infinite
line of charge. Rho (“row”), phi (fye), and z are the coordinates of
this system, where z is the height distance.  Name this
